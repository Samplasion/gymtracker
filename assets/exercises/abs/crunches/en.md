### Overview
Crunches are a popular abdominal exercise that targets the rectus abdominis. They are effective for building core strength and enhancing abdominal muscle definition.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie on your back on a mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
   - Place your hands behind your head, lightly supporting it with your fingertips, or cross your arms over your chest.
   - Engage your core and flatten your lower back against the floor.

2. **Crunching Phase:**
   - Lift your shoulders and upper back off the floor by contracting your abdominal muscles.
   - Exhale as you lift and keep your neck relaxed, leading the movement with your chest.
   - Raise your torso until your shoulder blades are off the ground and you feel a strong contraction in your abs.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your shoulders and upper back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping tension on your abs.
   - Inhale as you lower yourself back down.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Reverse Crunch:** Lift your hips off the ground instead of your shoulders to target the lower abs.
- **[Bicycle Crunch](exercise://library/library.abs.exercises.bicycleCrunches):** Alternate bringing opposite elbows to knees in a pedaling motion to engage the obliques.
- **Weighted Crunch:** Hold a weight plate or dumbbell against your chest to increase the resistance.

### Safety Considerations
- Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands. Keep your neck in a neutral position to prevent strain.
- Keep your lower back pressed against the floor throughout the movement to protect your spine.
- Avoid using momentum to lift your torso; focus on using your abdominal muscles.
