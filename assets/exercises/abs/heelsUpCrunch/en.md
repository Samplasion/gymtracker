### Overview
This is a variation of the traditional crunch that targets the rectus abdominis with added emphasis on the lower abs. Elevating your heels helps to isolate the abdominal muscles more effectively and reduces the involvement of the hip flexors.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie on your back on a mat with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle or, if you're using a Crunch bench, with your heels resting on an elevated surface.
   - Place your hands behind your head, lightly supporting it with your fingertips, or cross your arms over your chest.
   - Engage your core and flatten your lower back against the floor.

2. **Crunching Phase:**
   - Lift your shoulders and upper back off the floor by contracting your abdominal muscles.
   - Exhale as you lift and keep your neck relaxed, leading the movement with your chest.
   - Raise your torso until your shoulder blades are off the ground and you feel a strong contraction in your abs.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your shoulders and upper back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping tension on your abs.
   - Inhale as you lower yourself back down.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Safety Considerations
- If you're using a Crunch bench, ensure your heels are securely positioned on the elevated surface to maintain stability.
- Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands. Keep your neck in a neutral position to prevent strain.
- Keep your lower back pressed against the floor throughout the movement to protect your spine.
- Avoid using momentum to lift your torso; focus on using your abdominal muscles.
