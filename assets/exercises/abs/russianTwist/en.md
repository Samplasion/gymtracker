### Overview
The Russian Twist is a core exercise that targets the oblique muscles and enhances rotational strength and stability. It involves twisting the torso from side to side while keeping the lower body stable, often using a weight or medicine ball for added resistance.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
   - Lean back slightly to create a V-shape with your torso and thighs, keeping your back straight.
   - Hold a weight (medicine ball, dumbbell, or weight plate) with both hands in front of your chest.
2. **Execution:**
   - Engage your core and lift your feet off the ground.
   - Twist your torso to the right, bringing the weight beside your hip.
   - Return to the center and then twist to the left.
   - Continue alternating sides in a controlled manner.
3. **Breathing:**
   - Exhale as you twist to each side.
   - Inhale as you return to the center.
