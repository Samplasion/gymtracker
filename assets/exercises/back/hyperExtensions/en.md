### Overview
Hyperextensions are a bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the lower back muscles (erector spinae), with secondary engagement of the glutes and hamstrings. This exercise helps to strengthen the posterior chain and improve overall core stability.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Position yourself face down on a hyperextension bench with your hips resting on the pad and your feet securely anchored under the footpads.
   - Cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your head. Keep your body straight.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Lower your upper body towards the floor by bending at the hips.
   - Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
   - Lower until your upper body is just below parallel to the floor or you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.

3. **Raising Phase:**
   - Raise your upper body back to the starting position by contracting your lower back muscles.
   - Lift until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **[Weighted Hyperextensions](exercise://library/library.back.exercises.weightedHyperExtensions):** Hold a weight plate or dumbbell against your chest to increase the resistance.

### Safety Considerations
- Avoid excessively extending your back; stop when your body forms a straight line to prevent excessive strain on your spine.
- Ensure your feet are securely anchored to maintain stability during the exercise.
