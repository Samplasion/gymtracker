### Overview
Weighted Hyperextensions are an effective exercise that targets the lower back muscles (erector spinae) while also engaging the glutes and hamstrings. Adding weight increases the intensity of the exercise and helps to build greater strength and muscle mass in the posterior chain.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Position yourself face down on a hyperextension bench with your hips resting on the pad and your feet securely anchored under the footpads.
   - Hold a weight plate or dumbbell against your chest with your arms crossed over it.
   - Keep your body straight and your core engaged.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Lower your upper body towards the floor by bending at the hips.
   - Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
   - Lower until your upper body is just below parallel to the floor or you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.

3. **Raising Phase:**
   - Raise your upper body back to the starting position by contracting your lower back muscles.
   - Lift until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Isometric Hold:** Hold the raised position for a few seconds to increase the time under tension and challenge your muscles further.

### Safety Considerations
- Avoid excessively extending your back; stop when your body forms a straight line to prevent excessive strain on your spine.
- Ensure your feet are securely anchored to maintain stability during the exercise.
