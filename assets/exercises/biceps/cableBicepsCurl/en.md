### Overview
This is an effective exercise for building bicep strength and size, and the cable machine allows for a smooth and controlled motion.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Attach a straight bar or an EZ-curl bar to the low pulley of a cable machine.
   - Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart and grasp the bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
   - Step back slightly to create tension on the cable, and let your arms hang straight down.

2. **Curling Phase:**
   - Keeping your elbows close to your body, curl the bar up towards your shoulders by contracting your biceps.
   - Focus on keeping your upper arms stationary and only moving your forearms.
   - Continue curling until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping tension on the biceps.
   - Extend your arms fully at the bottom of the movement without locking your elbows.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Single-Arm Cable Bicep Curl:** Perform the exercise one arm at a time (with a D handle) to focus on one muscle at a time.
- **Rope Cable Bicep Curl:** Use a rope attachment instead of a bar to allow for a neutral grip.
- **Cable Preacher Curl:** Perform the exercise with a preacher bench to further isolate the biceps and reduce momentum.

### Safety Considerations
- Keep your back straight and avoid leaning back or using your body to lift the weight.
