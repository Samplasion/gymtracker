### Overview
The Concentration Curl is performed in a seated position, using a dumbbell, which helps to concentrate the effort on the bicep muscle, allowing for maximum contraction and muscle growth.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on a bench with your legs spread apart, your knees at a 90-degree angle, and your feet planted on the floor.
   - Hold a dumbbell in one hand and rest your upper arm on the inside of your thigh.
   - Lean forward slightly with your spine neutral and place your non-working hand on your opposite thigh.
   - Your working arm should be fully extended, holding the dumbbell just above the floor.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Squeeze your empty hand and extend it away from your body for balance. You can also hold onto your right knee.
   - Slowly curl the dumbbell upward towards your shoulder by contracting your bicep, but stop the curl when your triceps lose contact with your leg or when your upper arm is no longer perpendicular to the ground.
   - Keep your upper arm stationary and avoid swinging the weight.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arm.
   - Maintain control of the weight throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching to the other arm.

### Tips
- Avoid pressing your elbow into your knee, as this will use your leg for leverage to lift more weight, reducing the emphasis on your biceps.

### Variations
- **Standing Concentration Curl:** Perform the exercise in a standing position, bending over and resting your upper arm on your inner thigh.
- **Cable Concentration Curl:** Use a low pulley cable instead of a dumbbell to maintain constant tension on the bicep throughout the exercise.
