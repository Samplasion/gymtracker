### Overview
The Scott Curl, also known as the Preacher Curl, is an isolation exercise that targets the biceps. It is performed on a preacher bench, which helps to stabilize the upper arms and eliminate momentum, allowing for focused bicep contraction.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Adjust the preacher bench so that the padding supports your chest and armpits comfortably.
   - Sit on the bench and rest the back of your upper arms on the pad.
   - Grip a barbell or an EZ curl bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up), shoulder-width apart.
   - Extend your arms fully, allowing the bar to lower in front of you. This is your starting position.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Curl the bar upward towards your shoulders by contracting your biceps.
   - Keep your upper arms pressed against the pad and avoid lifting your elbows.
   - Focus on squeezing your biceps at the top of the movement.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
   - Maintain control of the bar throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
