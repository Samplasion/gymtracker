### Overview
The Single-Arm Cable Hammer Curl is an isolation exercise that targets the biceps and brachialis muscles. It is performed using a cable machine, which provides constant tension throughout the movement, enhancing muscle engagement.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Detach all handles from a low pulley on a cable machine: use the rubber grip.
   - Stand facing the machine and grab the handle with a neutral grip (thumbs facing up).
   - Position yourself so that the upper part of your working arm is perpendicular to the floor, your working forearm is parallel to the floor, and your feet are shoulder-width apart.
   - Keep your elbow close to your body and maintain a slight bend in your knees for stability. You can also hold your hips with your free hand for increased balance.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Curl the handle upward towards your shoulder by contracting your biceps and brachialis muscles.
   - Keep your upper arm stationary and focus on moving only your forearm.
   - Maintain a neutral grip throughout the movement.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the handle back to the starting position, fully extending your arm.
   - Maintain control of the weight throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching to the other arm.

### Tips
- Avoid pushing forward or otherwise moving your elbow, as it engages your shoulder muscles.
- Avoid swinging the handle or using your body to help lift the weight.
