### Overview
The Spider Curl is an isolation exercise that targets the biceps, specifically focusing on the peak contraction. This exercise is performed on an incline bench, allowing for a full range of motion and increased muscle activation.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Set an incline bench such that it is only slightly inclined (approximately a 30-degree angle).
   - Keep your shoulder blades in a neutral position (not adducted, abducted, elevated or depressed).
   - Lie face down on the bench, ensuring your chest and stomach are supported.
   - Hold a pair of dumbbells or a barbell with an underhand grip (palms facing up).
   - Let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders, fully extended.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Curl the weights upward towards your shoulders by contracting your biceps.
   - Keep your upper arms stationary and perpendicular to the floor and focus on using your biceps to lift the weight.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
   - Maintain control of the weights throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- If you're using a barbell, you might find that an EZ bar is better for your wrists.
- If you're using dumbbells, you can twist your forearms at the apex of the movement for a greater stimulaton of the bicep.
- Ensure you aren't bringing your elbows back, therefore engaging your back muscles.

### Variations
- **Barbell Spider Curl:** Use a barbell instead of dumbbells for a different grip and weight distribution.
- **Cable Spider Curl:** Use a low pulley cable for constant tension on the biceps throughout the exercise.
- **Single-Arm Spider Curl:** Perform the exercise one arm at a time to focus on muscle imbalances and increase intensity.
