### Overview
This exercise targets the calf muscles. It helps to strengthen and develop the calves, which are important for ankle stability and overall lower body strength.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart on a stable surface.
   - Place the balls of your feet on an elevated platform such as a calf raise machine, step, or weight plates.
   - Your heels should be hanging off the edge of the platform.

2. **Raising Phase:**
   - Push through the balls of your feet to lift your heels off the ground.
   - Rise as high as possible onto your toes, squeezing your calves at the top of the movement.
   - Hold the contraction briefly to maximize muscle engagement.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
   - Allow your heels to drop slightly below the level of the platform to stretch the calf muscles.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Single-Leg Standing Calf Raises:** Perform the exercise one leg at a time to focus on each calf individually and increase the challenge.
- **[Calf Press (on Leg Press Machine)](exercise://library/library.calves.exercises.calfPressLegPressMachine):** Use a Leg Press machine to perform calf presses, which allow for greater resistance and variation in foot placement.
- **[Seated Calf Raises](exercise://library/library.calves.exercises.calfRaiseSeated):** Perform calf raises while seated to emphasize the soleus muscle, which is deeper in the calf.

### Safety Considerations
- Avoid locking out your knees at the top of the movement to prevent strain on the joint.
- Warm up your calves with dynamic stretches or light aerobic activity before performing standing calf raises to reduce the risk of injury.
