### Overview
This is one of the most popular exercises for building upper body strength and muscle mass.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground.
   - Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
   - Lift the bar off the rack and hold it directly above your chest with your arms fully extended.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Lower the barbell slowly and with control to your mid-chest, bending your elbows and keeping them at a 45-degree angle to your body.
   - Ensure your wrists are straight and your forearms are perpendicular to the floor.

3. **Pressing Phase:**
   - Push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending your elbows and engaging your chest muscles.
   - Keep your back flat on the bench and your feet stable on the ground.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations

### Safety Considerations
- Use a spotter when lifting heavy weights to ensure safety.
- Avoid arching your back excessively to prevent lower back strain.
