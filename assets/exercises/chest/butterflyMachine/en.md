### Overview
The Butterfly Machine, also known as the Pec Deck, is an isolation exercise that targets the chest muscles, specifically the pectoralis major. It helps in building muscle mass and strength in the chest by allowing a focused and controlled movement.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Adjust the seat height so that the handles are at chest level when you are seated.
   - Sit on the machine with your back firmly against the backrest and your feet flat on the floor.
   - Grasp the handles with your palms facing forward and your elbows slightly bent.

2. **Closing Phase:**
   - Bring the handles together in front of your chest by contracting your chest muscles.
   - Keep your elbows slightly bent and maintain a controlled motion throughout.
   - Squeeze your chest muscles at the peak of the movement.

3. **Opening Phase:**
   - Slowly return the handles to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping tension on the chest muscles.
   - Ensure your elbows remain slightly bent and do not let the handles move too far back to avoid overstretching.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the movement to reduce strain on the shoulder joints.
