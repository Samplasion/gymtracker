### Overview
This is a compound exercise that primarily targets the upper chest muscles (pectoralis major), as well as the shoulders and triceps. Using a Smith machine provides added stability and control, making it easier to focus on muscle activation and form.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Adjust the bench to an incline angle of about 30-45 degrees and position it under the Smith machine bar.
   - Sit on the bench and lean back, ensuring your back and head are firmly supported.
   - Grip the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
   - Unrack the bar and position it directly above your upper chest.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the bar towards your upper chest by bending your elbows.
   - Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body to engage your chest muscles effectively.
   - Lower the bar until it just barely touches your chest, ensuring you maintain control and proper form.
     - Do not, however, bounce the bar on your chest. Doing so remove tension in your muscles, leading to a less effective workout.

3. **Pressing Phase:**
   - Push the bar back up to the starting position by extending your elbows.
   - Focus on contracting your chest muscles as you press the bar.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Safety Considerations
- Ensure the safety stops on the Smith machine are set at an appropriate height to catch the bar if you are unable to complete a rep.
- Avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement to prevent joint strain.
