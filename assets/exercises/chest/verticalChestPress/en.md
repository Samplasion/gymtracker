### Overview
The Vertical Chest Press provides a stable and controlled environment, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced lifters looking to build upper body strength.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Adjust the seat and backrest of the machine so that the handles are at chest level when you are seated.
   - Sit down with your back firmly against the backrest and your feet flat on the floor.
   - Grip the handles with your palms facing forward and your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle.

2. **Pressing Phase:**
   - Push the handles forward and upward by extending your elbows.
   - Focus on squeezing your chest muscles as you press.
   - Continue pressing until your arms are fully extended but not locked out.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly bring the handles back to the starting position by bending your elbows.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement to keep tension on the chest muscles.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- **Seat Adjustment:** Ensure the seat height is adjusted so that the handles are at chest level to target the chest muscles effectively.

### Variations
- **Neutral Grip Vertical Chest Press:** Use a neutral grip (palms facing each other) to place less stress on the shoulders and target the chest differently, if the machine's handles allow for that.
- **Incline/Decline Vertical Chest Press:** Some machines offer adjustable angles to target the upper or lower chest specifically.
