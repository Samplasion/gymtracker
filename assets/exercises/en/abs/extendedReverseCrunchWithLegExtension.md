### Overview
This is an advanced abdominal exercise that targets the lower abs while also engaging the hip flexors and obliques. This exercise combines the traditional reverse crunch with an added leg extension to increase intensity and effectiveness.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat.
   - Place your arms by your sides with your palms facing down for support.
   - Lift your legs off the ground, then bend your knees at a 90-degree angle so your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and your shins are parallel.

2. **Reverse Crunch Phase:**
   - Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground, extending your legs towards the ceiling.
   - Keep your movements controlled and focus on using your lower abs to lift your hips.

3. **Leg Extension Phase:**
   - Lower your legs and bring your knees to your chest.
   - Once your knees are close to your chest, extend your legs straight out, almost parallel to the floor.
   - Keep your core engaged and your lower back pressed into the mat.

Repeat phases 2 and 3 for the desired number of repetitions.
