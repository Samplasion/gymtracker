### Overview
This is an isolation exercise that targets the forearm extensors.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on a bench and hold the dumbbells with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
   - Rest your forearms on your thighs or the bench, with your wrists hanging off the edge.
   - Allow the dumbbells to roll down to your fingers to fully stretch the forearm extensors.

2. **Curl:**
   - Curl the dumbbells upward by extending your wrists, bringing the back of your hands towards your forearms.
   - Keep your forearms stationary on your thighs or the bench throughout the exercise.
   - Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, allowing them to roll back down to your fingers.
   - Maintain control of the dumbbells throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **[Reverse wrist curls (barbell)](exercise://library/library.forearms.exercises.reverseWristCurlsBarbell):** Use a barbell instead of dumbbells to increase overall weight load and ensure both forearms work together, promoting balanced strength development.
- **[Wrist curls (dumbbells)](exercise://library/library.forearms.exercises.wristCurlsBarbell)**: Perform the exercise with an underhand grip (palms facing up) to target the forearm flexors.
