### Overview
The Wrist Roller is a forearm exercise that helps strengthen the muscles of the wrist and improve grip strength.

### Execution
1. **Setup:**
   - Attach a wrist roller to a weighted object, such as a barbell or a dedicated wrist roller device.
   - Adjust the weight based on your strength level, starting with a manageable load.

2. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hold the wrist roller with both hands, palms facing down, and your arms extended straight out in front of you.
   - The roller should be hanging down, with the weight on the ground or a low surface.

3. **Rolling Motion:**
   - Rotate your wrists, alternating right and left, until the weight reaches the top of the roller.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement to prevent the weight from slipping back down.

4. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly reverse the motion to lower the weight back down to the starting position.
   - Control the descent to fully engage the forearm muscles throughout the exercise.

5. **Repeat:**
   - Continue rolling the wrist roller up and down for the desired number of repetitions or until fatigue sets in.
