### Overview
This exercise primarily targets the gluteal muscles, hamstrings, and core. It helps in strengthening the posterior chain, improving hip mobility, and enhancing overall lower body strength.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
   - Place your arms at your sides with your palms facing down.
   - Engage your core and ensure your lower back is pressed into the floor.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Press through your heels to lift your hips off the ground.
   - Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement and ensure your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.
   - Hold the position for a moment, focusing on the contraction in your glutes.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Single-Leg Glute Bridge:** Perform the exercise with one leg extended in the air to increase intensity and target each glute individually.
- **Weighted Glute Bridge:** Place a weight (e.g., barbell or dumbbell) across your hips to add resistance and further challenge your glutes.
- **Glute Bridge March:** Alternate lifting each leg while maintaining the bridge position to add a stability challenge and engage the core further.

### Safety Considerations
- Avoid pushing your hips too high, which can lead to lower back strain.
