### Overview
This exercise primarily targets the outer thigh muscles, specifically the gluteus medius and minimus. It helps in strengthening the muscles that move your legs away from the midline of your body, improving hip stability, balance, and overall lower body strength.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on the hip abduction machine with your back against the backrest.
   - Place your feet on the footrests and position your outer thighs against the padded levers.
   - Adjust the machine so that your legs are together in the starting position.

2. **Abduction Phase:**
   - Push against the padded levers with your outer thighs to move your legs apart.
   - Keep your back pressed against the backrest and your core engaged throughout the movement.
   - Hold the position for a moment, focusing on the contraction in your outer thighs and glutes.

3. **Returning Phase:**
   - Slowly release the tension and allow the levers to return to the starting position, controlling the movement to maintain tension on the muscles.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
