### Overview
This exercise primarily targets the glutes, but also engages the hamstrings and core. It is highly effective for building glute strength and muscle mass, improving hip extension, and enhancing overall lower body performance.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on the ground with your upper back resting against a bench or platform.
   - Roll a barbell over your hips or place a weight plate on your pelvis for resistance.
   - Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
   - Position the barbell or weight plate comfortably on your hips, using a pad if needed.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Drive through your heels to lift your hips towards the ceiling.
   - Extend your hips until your thighs are parallel to the ground and your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.
   - Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement and hold for a moment.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- **Pause Reps:** Add a pause at the top of the lift to increase time under tension and further challenge the glutes.

### Variations
- **Single-Leg Hip Thrust:** Perform the exercise with one leg extended to increase the intensity and focus on each glute individually.
- **[Hip Thrust Machine](exercise://library/library.hips.exercises.hipThrust):** Perform the exercise using a Hip Thrust machine for a stable and controlled environment.

### Safety Considerations
- Start with a lighter weight or body weight to master the form before adding resistance.
- Keep your core engaged to avoid over-arching your lower back.
- Avoid pushing your hips too high, which can lead to lower back strain.
- Use a barbell pad or towel to cushion your hips and prevent discomfort.
