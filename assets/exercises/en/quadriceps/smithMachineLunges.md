### Overview
Smith Machine Lunges are a variation of the traditional lunge performed using a Smith machine, which helps provide stability and control throughout the exercise.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Set the Smith machine bar to a suitable height for your body.
   - Stand under the bar and position it across your upper back and shoulders. Avoid placing it on your neck.
   - Grip the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
   - Position one foot forward and one foot back, ensuring your feet are hip-width apart. This is your starting stance.

2. **Execution:**
   - Lower your body by bending both knees until your back knee is just above the ground and your front thigh is parallel to the floor.
   - Ensure your front knee does not extend past your toes and keep your torso upright.
   - Push through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position.
   - Complete the desired number of repetitions on one leg before switching to the other leg.
