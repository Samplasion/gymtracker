### Overview
This is an isolation exercise that targets the triceps muscles. Using the cable machine allows for constant tension throughout the movement, enhancing muscle activation and growth.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Attach a rope or straight bar to the low pulley of a cable machine.
   - Stand facing away from the machine and grab the attachment with both hands.
   - Step forward to create tension in the cable, and position your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Lift the attachment overhead, with your elbows bent and close to your ears, and your upper arms in line with your torso.

2. **Extension Phase:**
   - Extend your elbows to push the attachment upward and forward until your arms are fully extended.
   - Focus on using your triceps to drive the movement, keeping your upper arms stationary and close to your head.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly bend your elbows to lower the attachment back to the starting position behind your head.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement to keep tension on the triceps.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Single-Arm Overhead Cable Extension:** Perform the exercise one arm at a time to focus on muscle imbalances and increase intensity.
