### Overview
This exercise involves holding weight plates together using a pinching grip, which enhances overall grip strength and forearm endurance.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Select two weight plates of the same size and weight.
   - Place the plates together with the smooth sides facing outwards (if there is a smooth side).
   - Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.

2. **Grip:**
   - Use your thumb on one side and your fingers on the other side to pinch the plates together.
   - Make sure to squeeze the plates tightly to prevent them from slipping.

3. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Lift the plates off the ground, keeping your arms straight and your shoulders relaxed.
   - Hold the plates at your sides or in front of you with a slight bend in your elbows.

4. **Holding Phase:**
   - Maintain the pinching grip and hold the plates for as long as you can, aiming for a set duration or until failure.
   - Keep your core engaged and maintain good posture throughout the hold.

5. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the plates back to the ground once you can no longer hold them or after the desired time has elapsed.
   - Release your grip and rest before repeating the exercise.

### Variations
- **Two-Plate Pinch:** Use two plates per hand to further challenge your grip strength.
- **Plate Pinch Holds:** Hold the plates for a specific duration, gradually increasing the time as your grip strength improves.
