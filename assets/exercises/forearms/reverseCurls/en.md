### Overview
This exercise is performed using a barbell or dumbbells and involves curling the weight with an overhand grip, which emphasizes the forearms and provides a balanced development of the arm muscles.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Hold a barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down), hands shoulder-width apart.
   - Let your arms hang straight down in front of you with your elbows close to your torso.

2. **Curling Phase:**
   - Curl the barbell upward towards your shoulders by bending your elbows.
   - Keep your upper arms stationary and focus on using your forearms and biceps to lift the weight.
   - Lift until your forearms are fully contracted and the barbell is at shoulder level.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
   - Maintain control of the barbell throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Dumbbell Reverse Curl:** Use dumbbells instead of a barbell to allow for a greater range of motion and to isolate each arm individually.
- **EZ-Bar Reverse Curl:** Use an EZ-bar to reduce strain on your wrists while maintaining the effectiveness of the exercise.
- **Cable Reverse Curl:** Use a low pulley cable machine for constant tension on the muscles throughout the movement.
