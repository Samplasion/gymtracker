### Overview
This is an isolation exercise that targets the forearm extensors.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on a bench and hold a barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down).
   - Rest your forearms on your thighs or the bench, with your wrists hanging off the edge.
   - Allow the barbell to roll down to your fingers to fully stretch the forearm extensors.

2. **Curl:**
   - Curl the barbell upward by extending your wrists, bringing the back of your hands towards your forearms.
   - Keep your forearms stationary on your thighs or the bench throughout the exercise.
   - Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, allowing it to roll back down to your fingers.
   - Maintain control of the barbell throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **[Reverse wrist curls (dumbbell)](exercise://library/library.forearms.exercises.reverseWristCurlsDumbbell):** Use dumbbells instead of a barbell to allow for a greater range of motion and to isolate each forearm individually.
- **[Wrist curls (barbell)](exercise://library/library.forearms.exercises.wristCurlsBarbell)**: Perform the exercise with an underhand grip (palms facing up) to target the forearm flexors.
