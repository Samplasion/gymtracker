### Overview
This is an isolation exercise that primarily targets the hamstrings. It helps to strengthen and develop the hamstrings, which are important for knee stability and overall lower body strength.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie face down on a leg curl machine with your knees just off the edge of the bench and your ankles secured under the padded lever.
   - Adjust the machine so the lever rests on the back of your lower legs just above your heels.
   - Grasp the handles or the sides of the bench for stability.

2. **Curling Phase:**
   - Flex your knees to curl the lever up towards your glutes.
   - Keep your hips pressed against the bench and your torso still.
   - Raise the lever as far as possible while maintaining control, squeezing your hamstrings at the top of the movement.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly extend your knees to lower the lever back to the starting position.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement to maximize muscle engagement and avoid using momentum.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
