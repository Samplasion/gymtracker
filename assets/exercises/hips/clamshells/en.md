### Overview
This exercise primarily targets the gluteus medius and minimus, which are crucial for hip stability and strength. It is particularly beneficial for improving hip mobility, preventing injuries, and enhancing overall lower body function.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie on your side with your legs stacked and your knees bent at a 90-degree angle.
   - Rest your head on your lower arm and place your upper hand on your hip in order to prevent rotation.
   - Ensure your heels are aligned with your glutes and your core is engaged.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Keeping your feet together, lift your top knee as high as you can without rotating your pelvis or back.
   - Focus on engaging your glute muscles to lift your knee.
   - Hold the position at the top for a moment, squeezing your glutes.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your knee back to the starting position with control.
   - Maintain the tension in your glutes throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

### Safety Considerations
- Start without a resistance band to master the form before adding resistance.
- Avoid using momentum to lift your knee; focus on slow, controlled movements.
