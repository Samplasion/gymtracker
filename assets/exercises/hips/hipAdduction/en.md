### Overview
This exercise primarily targets the inner thigh muscles, specifically the adductor group. It helps in strengthening the muscles that bring your legs together, improving stability and overall lower body strength.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on the hip adduction machine with your back against the backrest.
   - Place your feet on the footrests and position your thighs against the padded levers.
   - Adjust the machine so that your legs are comfortably spread apart, creating an initial stretch in your inner thighs.

2. **Adduction Phase:**
   - Squeeze your inner thighs to bring the levers together, moving your legs towards the midline of your body.
   - Keep your back pressed against the backrest and your core engaged throughout the movement.
   - Hold the position for a moment, focusing on the contraction in your inner thighs.

3. **Returning Phase:**
   - Slowly release the tension and allow the levers to return to the starting position, controlling the movement to maintain tension on the muscles.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
