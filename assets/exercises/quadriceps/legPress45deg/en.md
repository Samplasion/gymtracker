### Overview
This exercise is performed on a leg press machine where the backrest is set at a 45-degree angle, allowing you to push a weighted platform away from your body using your legs.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on the leg press machine with your back and head resting against the padded support.
   - Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, ensuring your heels are flat and toes are slightly turned out.
   - Adjust the seat so that your knees are at a 90-degree angle (or slightly less) when in the starting position.
   - Grasp the handles on the sides of the machine for stability.

2. **Execution:**
   - Press the platform away from your body by extending your knees and hips, pushing through your heels.
   - Continue pressing until your legs are almost fully extended _but avoid locking your knees_.
   - Pause briefly at the top of the movement.
   - Slowly lower the platform back to the starting position by bending your knees, ensuring they move towards your chest in a controlled manner.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- **Foot Placement:** Adjust your foot placement to target different muscles. Higher placement emphasizes the hamstrings and glutes, while lower placement targets the quadriceps more. Regardless, it's important not to lower your feet so much that the toes sit lower than the knees.
- **Avoid Locking Knees:** Do not fully lock your knees at the top of the movement to prevent joint stress.
- **Controlled Movements:** Perform the exercise with a controlled tempo to maximize muscle engagement and reduce injury risk.
- **Breathing:** Exhale as you press the weight up and inhale as you lower it back down.

### Safety Considerations
- Ensure your lower back remains in contact with the pad to avoid strain.
- Avoid bouncing the weight at the bottom of the movement to protect your knees and joints.
