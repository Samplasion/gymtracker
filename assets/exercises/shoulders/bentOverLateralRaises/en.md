The Bent-Over Cable Lateral Raise is an isolation exercise that targets the rear deltoids (back of the shoulders), with secondary engagement of the upper back muscles such as the rhomboids and trapezius. This exercise helps improve shoulder stability and develop the rear delts, contributing to balanced shoulder development.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Set the pulleys on a cable machine to the lowest position.
   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing sideways, and grasp the handle with an underhand grip.
   - You can lean your free hand on your knees for support.
   - Bend at the hips to lean forward, keeping your back flat and your core engaged. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor.
   - Let your arm hang straight down in front of you with a slight bend in your elbow.

2. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Raise your arm out to your side in a wide arc, keeping a slight bend in your elbow.
   - Lift the handles until your arms are in line with your shoulders or slightly higher.
   - Focus on squeezing your rear deltoids at the top of the movement.

3. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower the cables back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
