### Overview
Handstand Push-Ups are an advanced bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the shoulders (deltoids) and triceps, with secondary engagement of the upper chest and core. This exercise helps to build significant upper body strength and stability.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Position yourself in a handstand against a wall with your hands placed shoulder-width apart on the floor.
   - Keep your body straight, core engaged, and feet resting lightly against the wall for balance.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Bend your elbows to lower your head towards the floor.
   - Keep your elbows tucked in close to your body to target the shoulders and triceps effectively.
   - Lower yourself until your head nearly touches the ground, maintaining control throughout the movement.

3. **Pushing Phase:**
   - Push through your hands to extend your elbows and raise your body back to the starting position.
   - Focus on using your shoulder and tricep muscles to drive the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- Ensure your hands are positioned shoulder-width apart to maintain balance and effectively target the shoulders and triceps.

### Variations
- **Pike Push-Ups:** If you are not yet able to perform handstand push-ups, start with pike push-ups to build the necessary shoulder and tricep strength.
- **Wall Handstand Hold:** Practice holding a handstand against the wall to build balance and stability before attempting push-ups.
- **Freestanding Handstand Push-Ups:** Once you have mastered wall-assisted handstand push-ups, progress to performing them without the wall for a greater challenge.

### Safety Considerations
- Warm up your shoulders, triceps, and wrists thoroughly before performing handstand push-ups to reduce the risk of injury.
- Consider having a spotter or training partner assist you when first attempting handstand push-ups to ensure safety and proper form.
