### Overview
This exercise is performed using a dual-cable machine, providing continuous tension throughout the movement and allowing for greater muscle activation.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand in the center of a dual-cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Set the pulleys to the lowest position and attach a handle to each cable.
   - Grab the left handle with your right hand and the right handle with your left hand, crossing the cables in front of you.
   - Stand upright with a slight bend in your elbows and your arms hanging down by your sides.
   - Engage your core to maintain stability.

2. **Execution:**
   - Begin the movement by lifting your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, forming a "T" shape with your body.
   - Keep a slight bend in your elbows and ensure your wrists remain straight.
   - Pause briefly at the top of the movement to maximize muscle contraction.
   - Slowly lower the handles back to the starting position with controlled movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
