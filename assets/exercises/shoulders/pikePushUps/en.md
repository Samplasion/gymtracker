### Overview
Pike Push-Ups are a bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the shoulders (deltoids), along with the triceps and upper chest. This exercise is a great progression towards developing the strength necessary for handstand push-ups and other advanced shoulder movements.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Begin in a standard push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
   - Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, forming an inverted V-shape with your body. Your legs and arms should be straight, and your head should be between your arms, looking towards your feet.
   - Position your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart to stabilize your movement.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Bend your elbows and lower your head towards the floor by flexing at the shoulders.
   - Keep your elbows flared out to the sides and your legs straight.
   - Lower yourself until your head nearly touches the ground, maintaining control throughout the movement.

3. **Pushing Phase:**
   - Push through your hands to extend your elbows and raise your body back to the starting position.
   - Focus on using your shoulder muscles to drive the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Elevated Pike Push-Ups:** Place your feet on an elevated surface such as a bench or step to increase the intensity and target the shoulders more.
- **Handstand Push-Ups:** Once you have mastered pike push-ups, progress to handstand push-ups against a wall to further challenge your shoulder strength.
- **Pike Push-Ups on Parallettes:** Use parallettes to perform the exercise, which allows for a greater range of motion and increased shoulder activation.

### Safety Considerations
- Ensure your hips remain elevated to maintain the proper pike position and effectively target the shoulder muscles.
