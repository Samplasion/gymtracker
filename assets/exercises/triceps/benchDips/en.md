### Overview
This is a bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the triceps, with secondary engagement of the chest and shoulders. They are effective for building upper body strength and can be performed with minimal equipment.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Sit on the edge of a bench with your hands gripping the edge, fingers pointing forward and elbows slightly bent.
   - Extend your legs straight out in front of you with your heels on the floor. For an easier variation, keep your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
   - Slide your hips off the bench, supporting your weight with your hands.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly bend your elbows to lower your body towards the floor.
   - Keep your back close to the bench and your elbows pointing straight back.
   - Lower yourself until your upper arms are parallel to the floor, or you feel a stretch in your shoulders.

3. **Pushing Phase:**
   - Push through your palms to extend your elbows and raise your body back to the starting position.
   - Focus on using your triceps to drive the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Weighted Bench Dips:** Place a weight plate or dumbbell on your lap to increase the resistance and challenge your triceps further.
### Safety Considerations
- Avoid lowering your body too far, as this can place excessive strain on your shoulder joints.
