### Overview
This is a bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the triceps, with secondary engagement of the chest. This variation of the push-up increases the intensity on the triceps by narrowing the hand placement.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Begin in a standard push-up position with your body in a straight line from head to heels.
   - Place your hands close together directly under your chest, forming a diamond shape with your thumbs and index fingers touching.
   - Keep your feet together and your core engaged to maintain a straight body line.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Bend your elbows to lower your chest towards the diamond shape formed by your hands.
   - Keep your elbows close to your body as you lower yourself down.
   - Lower until your chest nearly touches your hands or you feel a strong contraction in your triceps.

3. **Pushing Phase:**
   - Push through your hands to extend your elbows and raise your body back to the starting position.
   - Focus on using your triceps to drive the movement.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
