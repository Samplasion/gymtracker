### Overview
This exercise can be performed using parallel bars or a dip station.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Stand between the parallel bars and grip them firmly with your palms facing inward.
   - Lift yourself up so your arms are fully extended and your body is straight.
   - Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are at least parallel to the floor.
   - Keep your elbows close to your body to emphasize the triceps, or flare them out slightly to engage more of the chest.
   - Lean slightly forward to increase chest activation, or stay upright to focus on the triceps.

3. **Lifting Phase:**
   - Push yourself back up to the starting position by extending your elbows.
   - Avoid locking your elbows at the top of the movement to maintain tension on the muscles and to avoid injuries.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Tips
- If there is not enough space, you can bend your knees. But don't cross your ankles: doing so prevents core activation and makes the exercise easier at the expense of muscle engagement.

### Variations
- **Bench Dips:** Use a bench or chair behind you, placing your hands on the edge and your feet on the floor or another bench. This variation is less intense and suitable for beginners.
- **Weighted Dips:** Add weight using a dip belt, a dumbbell between your feet, or a weighted vest to increase the intensity.
- **Assisted Dips:** Use an assisted dip machine or resistance bands to help support some of your body weight if you are unable to perform bodyweight dips.

### Safety Considerations
- Warm up properly before performing dips to prepare your muscles and joints.
- Avoid dipping too low to prevent shoulder strain or injury.
- If you experience shoulder pain, reduce the range of motion. Ensure your equipment is stable and secure to prevent accidents.
