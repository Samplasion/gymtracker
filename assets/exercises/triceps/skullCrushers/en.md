### Overview
Skull Crushers are an isolation exercise that primarily targets the triceps.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the floor.
   - Hold an EZ bar or a straight barbell with a shoulder-width grip, palms facing forward.
     - If you're using dumbbells, position them directly over your eyes.
   - Extend your arms fully so the bar is directly above your chest.

2. **Lowering Phase:**
   - Keeping your upper arms stationary, bend your elbows to lower the bar towards your forehead.
   - Stop when the bar is just above your forehead or slightly behind it, or when you feel tension in your triceps, maintaining control throughout the movement.

3. **Raising Phase:**
   - Push through your triceps to extend your elbows and raise the bar back to the starting position.
   - Focus on using your triceps to drive the movement, keeping your upper arms still.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Dumbbell Skull Crushers:** Perform the exercise with dumbbells instead of a barbell.
