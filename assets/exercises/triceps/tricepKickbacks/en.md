### Overview
Tricep Kickbacks are an isolation exercise that targets the triceps.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Hold a dumbbell in your hand with a neutral grip.
   - Assume a split stance with the opposite leg.
   - Place your free hand on your hip.
   - Bend at the hips to lean forward, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
   - Bring your upper arm close to your torso, elbow bent at a 90-degree angle. Your upper arm should be lined up with the torso.

2. **Extension Phase:**
   - Keeping your upper arm stationary, extend your elbow to straighten your arm, pushing the dumbbell back. Keep your wrist rigid.
   - Squeeze your tricep at the top of the movement, ensuring your arm is fully extended.

3. **Returning Phase:**
   - Slowly bend your elbow to return to the starting position, keeping your upper arm close to your torso.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching to the other arm.

### Tips
- Don't swing your weight. Instead, use a smooth, controlled movement.
