### Overview
Performed using a cable machine with a rope attachment, this exercise helps build strength and definition in the triceps.

### Execution
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Attach a rope to the high pulley of a cable machine.
   - Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
   - Grab the rope with a neutral grip (palms facing each other), and position your hands near the ends of the rope.
   - Pull the rope down with your upper arms are close to your sides, until your elbows are bent at a 90-degree angle.

2. **Pushdown Phase:**
   - Extend your elbows to push the rope downward until your arms are fully extended.
   - At the bottom of the movement, separate the ends of the rope and push slightly outward to maximize triceps contraction.
   - Keep your upper arms stationary and close to your sides throughout the movement.

3. **Returning Phase:**
   - Slowly bend your elbows to return the rope to the starting position, allowing your hands to come back together.
   - Maintain control throughout the movement to keep tension on the triceps.
   - Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

### Variations
- **Single-Arm Rope Pushdown:** Perform the exercise one arm at a time to focus on muscle imbalances and increase intensity.
- **V-Bar Pushdown:** Use a V-bar attachment instead of a rope for a different grip and muscle engagement.
- **Reverse Grip Pushdown:** Use an underhand grip with a straight bar to target the triceps differently.
