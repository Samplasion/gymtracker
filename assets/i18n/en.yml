      title: What's this?
      warmUp: A warm-up set is a light set of an exercise that you perform before the actual working sets. Its purpose is to prepare your muscles for the upcoming heavy work.
      normal: A normal set is a regular set of an exercise, where you perform a certain amount of reps with a certain weight.
      drop: A drop set is a set where you drop the weight after reaching failure and continue to perform reps with the lower weight.
      failure: A failure set is a set where you perform reps until you reach technical failure.
      failureStripping: A failure set with stripping is a kind of failure set where you perform reps until you reach technical failure, then you strip some weight and continue to perform reps with the lower weight, without resting.
